Figma Your Life

I created a your life page for Zuko with the landing page, interests page, and accomplishments page.

Peer Review

Reviewer: Elizabeth Trotter

Reviewer comments: I'm a big fan of Avatar so I'm biased when I say this; but, I love the theme! I do have a few suggestions for your project: make sure to change the title in the head from the default bootstrap one, add a description to your alts in all the img tags, maybe have a "pages" folder for your html files (other than the root index.html), and try to make the formatting more consistent on the home page (about me section). Let me know if this makes sense or if you have any questions, thanks!
